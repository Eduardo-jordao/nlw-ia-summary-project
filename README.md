# AI Shorts Summary

The primary objective of this application is to curate and present succinct summaries of videos categorized as "shorts" on the YouTube platform. To accomplish this, I harnessed the power of the Xenova/whisper-small model to transcribe audio content into text and used the Xenova/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model to generate concise summaries.


## What I learned

- Use of local servers
- Get and post methods
- Asynchronous  functions with Promisses
- Use of libraries
- AI models implementations
